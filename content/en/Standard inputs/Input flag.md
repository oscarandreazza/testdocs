The **Input flags** on Ritchie has been developed to give one more option to use input parameters through command lines.

Therefore, the input parameters need to be informed in the following pattern:

```text
RIT (GROUP) VERB NOUN --input_name="input_value"
```

{{% /alert %}}

For more information about **Input Flags**, check out the [**Formulas commands**]({{< ref path="Standard inputs/Formulas commands" >}}) section.
