* For more information about Release Notes and Ritchie versions, check out the [**Reference section**]({{< ref path="Reference/Release notes" >}}).

## **How does Ritchie work?**

In Ritchie's context, everything works through **formulas**. This means that **a formula is a script** that can be automatically executed or interactively through a command line.

When you adapt an existing script to Ritchie's structure, it allows you to run it locally or through **Docker**, and to share it on **Bitbucket**, **Github**, or **Gitlab** repository.
