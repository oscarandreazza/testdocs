When you inform inputs through **arguments** or **flags** allows you to automate workflows. 

This is useful when you manipulate other tools within a script, as you can automate operations without interacting with the terminal.

### **How can you inform the input parameters?**
Basically, there are two ways to inform input parameters directly on the command lines:

1. Through the STDIN flag . _**(will be deprecated in early 2021)**_
2. Through Input flags.

For more information about them, check out the following sections:

- [**STDIN flags**]({{< ref path="Stdin flag" >}}).
