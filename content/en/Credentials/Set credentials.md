You have to set Ritchie's credentials to avoid inform data multiples times through the terminal.

To do so, run the following command: 

```text
rit set credential
```

The terminal will return this message: 

```text
? Select your provider [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> kubeconfig
  ansible
  aws
  github
  gitlab
  jenkins
  Add a new
```

After you chose one of the available providers, Ritchie will ask you to fill the following fields: 

```text
? Select your provider github
? username: DennisRitchie
? email: dennis.ritchie@zup.com.br
? token: 
âœ” Github credential saved!
```

{{% alert color="info" %}}

For more information about the formula's editable files and to see how to manipulate the credentials defined in the session as formula input parameters (inputs in the config.json file), check out the [**Formulas section**]({{< ref path="Formulas/Organize the formula folder" >}}).

{{% /alert %}}
