## **How was Ritchie created?**

Ritchie's goal is to improve the developerâ€™s experience, giving them more autonomy to automate and simplify the execution of commands used in the process of creating and developing digital products. 

The name is a tribute to **Dennis Ritchie**, one of the Unix (predecessor of Linux) creators and also of the C language, which allowed the creation of the digital world as we know it today.

Despite a great number of multidisciplinary teams in the market, there is a challenge to reduce the dependence developers have on inputs that come from infrastructure and operations teams. **DevOps** helped remedy the situation, but it did not eliminate the dependency between areas.

Ritchie's team bring a tool to the community that promotes a **NoOps** movement, a solution that automates repetitive operations and streamlines processes (also known as toil) that are often hampered in the infrastructure.

This will give developers the ability to perform operations that were exclusively the infrastructure's domain.

In that way, professionals - on all fronts - gain time to work on more complex and relevant tasks to generate value for their projects.

## **What makes Ritchie different?**

As a CLI tool, Ritchie seeks to improve the operational **developers'** **experience and brings beneficial such as:**

- Simplify repetitive and easy-to-execute tasks
- Reduce the rework
- Promote more time for the development team to focus on their deliveries.

So, instead of writing down on the command lines which parameters and/or arguments the user needs to inform, we do the opposite: 
- Ritchie presents the available options and goes, line by line, asking for the information needed for the command to work, in an interactive way.

In the example below, you will see the execution of a scaffold command with the coffee formula. 
When the user signals which formula he wants to use, the system automatically passes, line by line, asking which specific parameters must be considered to perform the desired action.
