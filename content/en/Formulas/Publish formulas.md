## **How to publish?**

There is a formula on Ritchie that allows the user to create and/or update a formula repository on Github/Gitlab.

### **Premisses**

{{% alert color="warning" %}}

To publish your formula, make sure to set Github / Gitlab credentials using the **`rit set credential`** command.

{{% /alert %}}

## **Publish your repository**

A formula has been created on the community repository to perform:

* Initialize a local repository on Git (if necessary).
* Create the repository on Github/Gitlab.
* Generate release of a new version of the repository.
* Add the repository to Ritchie local repositories (**`rit add repo`** command).

{{% alert color="info" %}}

Moreover, if the repository already exists, it will commit the new code and generate the new release version informed, before updating Ritchie repositories ( **`rit update repo`** command).

{{% /alert %}}

```text
rit publish repo
```

The user has to inform 5 different kinds of inputs:

1. The **`provider`** (Github or Gitlab).
2. The **`repository's privacy`**.
3. The **`repository's name`**.
4. The **`local repository path`** you wish to publish.
5. The **`release version`** to generate.

You can check if the publication has been successful by using the **`rit list repo`** command and see if the published repository appears.

{{% /alert %}}

## **Publish manually**

To publish a formula manually, you need to push it on a **Github/Gitlab** repository, following these steps:

1. You need to aave an exclusive repository for formulas on Github / Gitlab. _It can be created from the a local repository, or based on a cloned repository._
2. Add your formulas to the repository _Using the **`rit create formula`** command, or **copy / paste** folders_
3. Commit and push the new code to the Github/Gitlab repository.
4. Generate a new release of the formulas repository.
